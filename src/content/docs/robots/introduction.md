You now have (or soon will) a hand-built [Misty I](../misty-i) or early prototype [Misty II](../misty-ii) robot from the Misty Robotics team. When your robot arrives, please read these docs for some quick, out-of-box assembly steps and other helpful details.

Once you get your robot powered up, you can quickly control Misty via her [Companion App](../../apps/companion-app), [Blockly](../../apps/blockly), or the [Command Center](../../apps/command-center). The real fun starts when you write your first skill for Misty; go [here](../../../docs/skills/introduction) to get started coding Misty.
