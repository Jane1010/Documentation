## Visual Studio Code Extension

You can use the Misty skills extension for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to aid in skill development. This extension provides a list of the available methods in Misty's on-robot JavaScript API.

Access to the Misty skills extension is currently limited to a small group of field trial robot testers. If you are a field trial tester, you can access your extension download in the Field Trials section of the [Community forums](https://community.mistyrobotics.com/).
