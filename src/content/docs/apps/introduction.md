You can easily control Misty via her apps:

* The [Companion App](../companion-app) is the simplest way to get Misty onto your local Wi-Fi network and to test out driving Misty manually.
* The [Command Center](../command-center) provides a graphic UX that allows you to experiment with Mistyâ€™s API commands before you write any code.
* The [API Explorer](../api-explorer) provides interactive access to Misty's REST API. Use this tool to experiment with different commands and generate code samples to use in your skills.
* [Blockly](../blockly) is a beginner-friendly coding tool for Misty that is ideal for kids and classroom use.

Once you do get Misty on your network, you can also just skip straight on to [coding Misty](../../../docs/skills/introduction).
