Misty's API Explorer provides interactive access to Misty's REST API endpoints. You can use the API Explorer to:

* browse the list of Misty's REST API endpoints
* send REST API commands to Misty
* experiment with different parameters
* generate code samples for Misty's REST API or on-robot JavaScript API

The API Explorer simplifies experimenting with different commands, so you can quickly see how Misty responds and understand how to use different commands in the code you write for Misty. For more information about using Misty's APIs, see the REST API and on-robot JavaScript API reference documentation.
